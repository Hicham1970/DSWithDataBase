# DSWithDataBase:
This is an Excel Draft Survey program with some tricks to make the job more easier.
To use this program, first,  you have to activate the Macros in your machine, and then create a folder in your Desktop and name it PrintOut to be recognized as 
the folder where all the printing documents are saved.
The Draft survey program is based on the classic formulas and a small database of 107 vessels with their particulars as LBP, LOA, Flag, Port of registry, GT, NT
and the more, just choose the vessel and his data will be displayed and tweaked if necessary.
Tree Vba modules are used here: ErrorHandling Module, SaveAsPdf and HideShowAll to give some fun to the application.
NB: If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, it will be great if you add your fingerprint to this project.
